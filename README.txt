Project 3

By: Gabi Appel

Due: 03/21/19

Purpose: The purpose of this project is to familiarize ourselves with semaphores. It will read a file into shared memory and fork off processes. The child will decided if it's a palindrome or not, then send it to the proper output file. 

How to Run:
	
	./master -h 		//pulls up the help menu
	./master -f inputfile 	//specifies the file 

Issues:
	I think I got semaphores started... Unforunately, I have a difficult time putting things together properly and I couldn't figure out how to make it work. I don't know what I'm doing ):
